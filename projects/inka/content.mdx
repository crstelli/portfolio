# Overview

**Inka** is a fast, lightweight **note-taking application** focused on clarity, performance, and a distraction-free writing experience. It enables users to create, edit, and organize notes through a clean text-editor interface inspired by modern knowledge-management tools.

The app features a sleek landing page, a frictionless Google login flow, an autosaving markdown-ready editor powered by TipTap, a responsive UI, and seamless theme switching.

The project was built with **Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Prisma**, integrating libraries like **TipTap**, **shadcn/ui**, **lucide-react**, and **Auth.js** for authentication.

## Technical Decisions

- **Next.js + React**: Ensures a structured, scalable architecture with optimized routing and server-side capabilities.

- **PostgreSQL + Prisma**: Provides a robust relational database layer with type-safe queries and schema-driven development.

- **TailwindCSS**: Enables fast styling and a consistent design language throughout the application.

- **TipTap Editor**: Delivers a powerful, extensible editor for markdown-style writing with full control over events and custom styling.

- **Auth.js (Google Provider)**: Implements a secure, fast login experience with OAuth integration.

- **shadcn/ui**: Supplies a modern component base aligned with the overall minimalist design.

- **Vercel Deployment**: Ensures high performance, zero-config deployment, and automatic optimizations.

## Challenges

One major challenge was **integrating the TipTap editor** while maintaining a clean UX. Handling all editor events, managing custom styling, and syncing real-time changes required precise control over state and extensions.

Implementing a **debounced saving system** was another key challenge. To prevent excessive database operations, edits are saved only after user inactivity. This system reduced write operations by **approximately 90%**, significantly improving performance and resource usage.

Creating a seamless **autosave flow** required careful tuning of timers, React state, and Prisma write logic to avoid conflicts or stale data.

Managing authentication with Google, integrating PostgreSQL through Prisma, and building a refined dark/light theme with shadcn/ui pushed the project to a higher level of polish and technical depth.

## Key Features

1. **Landing Page**: Minimalist introduction to the app and its core value: fast, focused note-taking.

2. **Google Authentication**: Secure login flow powered by Auth.js and the Google provider.

3. **Autosaving Editor**: Notes are saved automatically after the user stops typing.

4. **Debounced Write System**: Reduces database calls by ~90% through intelligent batching of edits.

5. **TipTap Markdown Editor**: Clean writing environment with rich editing capabilities.

6. **Responsive Design**: Fluid layout optimized for all screen sizes.

7. **Modern UI Components**: Built with shadcn/ui and enhanced with lucide-react icons.

8. **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL + Prisma handles all note storage and querying.

9. **Dark/Light Theme Support**: Managed with shadcn's theme provider for consistent UX.

## Future Improvements

- _Login_: Add traditional **email/password login** and more authentication providers.

- _Sharing notes_: Allow users to **share notes** with others.

- _Nested notes_: Support **nested notes** for hierarchical structures.

- _Folder organization_: Introduce **folder organization** for advanced sorting and grouping.

## Lessons & Final Considerations

Building Inka strengthened my ability to work with **third-party libraries**, navigate documentation effectively, and integrate complex tools like TipTap into real applications. Managing authentication flows, building a relational database schema with PostgreSQL and Prisma, and optimizing performance through **debouncing** and **autosave strategies** expanded my backend and frontend competencies.

This project enhanced my understanding of **full-stack architecture**, efficient data management, and the challenges of creating a polished, responsive, and extensible note-taking experience.
