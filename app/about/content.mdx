I'm Giuseppe Crescitelli, a **20-year-old** self-taught developer driven by a deep passion for **technology** and **innovation**.

I discovered web development during lockdown and have since **committed myself fully**, especially in the last three months, studying up to ten hours a day.

Im motivated by **constant growth**, disciplined execution, and the pursuit of **better solutions to complex problems**.
I thrive in environments that are stimulating, fast-paced, and surrounded by people
who think **ambitiously**.

Im adaptable, relentless in learning, and firmly aligned with my
**long-term goals**.

## What can I do

I'm proficient with modern frontend technologies, working daily with **Next.js**, TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui to build clean and efficient interfaces.

I prioritize **maintainability**, **scalability**, and **clarity** in every project.

I’m naturally drawn to innovation, so I actively explore new tools and frameworks, focusing on understanding their purpose and **real-world value**.

My workflow is driven by constant improvement and a commitment to staying aligned with the latest industry standards.

## My Approach to work

My approach to work is grounded in **discipline** and deliberate **planning** — every project starts with a clear structure, and I stay focused until the task is fully resolved.

I value team collaboration as a way to learn from people with greater experience and refine my own thinking.

I manage projects with an optimization mindset, improving what matters and dedicating significant time to thoughtful refactoring to ensure clarity, performance, and **long-term maintainability**.

## Values and Mindset

Choosing the self-taught path was **intentional** — it allows me to push my discipline to the limit and take full responsibility for my growth.

  Learning without a predefined roadmap forces effective self-management, a
  skill I consider essential in both tech and life.

By designing my own learning path, I’ve learned to stay accountable, adapt quickly, and **build competence without relying on external** structure.

## My Technical Story

I wrote my first lines of code at 11, learning C++ with the naive goal of creating game cheats — a challenge that proved too difficult at the time but left a clear **sense of unfinished business**.

During lockdown I picked up JavaScript out of curiosity and discovered the world of **web development**, starting with HTML, CSS, and then **JavaScript** through English courses on Udemy.

Building my first projects led me to React, whose underlying logic and purpose immediately resonated with me.

From there, I deepened my understanding of **how the web works** under the hood — from TCP/IP to CDNs — and gradually adopted modern tools like Next.js and TailwindCSS, keeping pace with what the industry demands and where it’s heading.

## What Am I Looking For

I’ve reached a point where real progress requires **stepping into new environments** and **collaborating** with people who are more **experienced** than I am.

I’m looking for a company where **I can learn**, **contribute**, and **grow** alongside a team that values **ambition** and shared improvement.

I believe strongly that **working together** accelerates both individual development and the collective strength of the team.
